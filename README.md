# Studylog Web Take-Home Assessment

## Problem Statement
1. Users want the ability to create a custom data processor using a drag-and-drop style interface.
1. Users to be able to create, read, update, and delete these user-created "workflows".

## Requirements
1. Backend API uses a well established open-source framework. (Express, Next.js, etc)
1. User interface should be written in React.js
1. The selected graph library for this project is [react-digraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-digraph)

## Specifications

### Frontend challenge
* User interface should allow users to create a new "workflow".
* User interface should allow users to drag and drop "processors" onto a canvas.
* User interface should allow users to assign a name to a "processor" on the canvas.
* User interface should allow users to link "processors" by dragging an arrow between them.

### Full stack challenge
* User interface should allow users to list existing "workflows".
* User interface should allow users to open an existing "workflow".
* User interface should allow users to update a "workflow".
* User interface should allow users to delete a "workflow".

### Algorithm challenge
* If a link line is part of a circular reference, change its color to red.

## What we're looking for
* Architecture. (is this application structurally sound?)
* Best practices. (are industry best practices observed?)
* Experience. (does this reflect a strong understanding of the language/concepts?)
* Elegance. (is this concept as simple as it could/should be?)
* Readability. (is the code easy to reason about?)
* Cleanliness. (how does this codebase ensure appropriate styles? conventions?)
* Unit testing. (are tests functional? do they focus on the right things?)
* Portability. (does the code have meaningful abstractions, componentization?)

## Submission
* When you have completed the challenge, please send an email letting us know.
* Please update this README file with instructions for running your application.
